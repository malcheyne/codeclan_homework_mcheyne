# MVP

## The Titanic

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Fig. 1.** The RMS Titanic leaving Southport, 10th April 1912 (public domain)", out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RMS_Titanic.jpg")
```

A data set detailing the survival or death of passengers and crew members on the RMS Titanic is given in the `data` folder for this homework - use this data and **not** the built-in `Titanic` dataset in `R`. 

Some time after the disaster a journalist wrote that crew members were *more likely* to have survived the sinking than passengers. This was disputed by a descendant of one of the surviving crew members, who suggested that the opposite was true, i.e. passengers were *more likely* to have survived than crew.  

**Question**  
Calculate the conditional probabilities $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{survived} \mid \textrm{crew})$ and $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{survived} \mid \textrm{passenger})$ to settle this dispute.

Have a look at the distinct values of the `class` variable, this will tell you whether each individual was a passenger (1st, 2nd or 3rd class) or a member of the crew (treat restaurant staff as crew)

**Loading packages**

You may want to use `prob` and `gtools` later in the homework, and the `tidyverse` for this section, but if you load `prob` after `tidyverse`, `dplyr::filter()` will be masked. So load your packages in this order:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(prob)
library(gtools)
library(tidyverse)
```

<details>
<summary>**Hints**</summary>

* You may want to create a `crew` column containing values `TRUE` or `FALSE` to help with this
* For $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{survived} \mid \textrm{crew})$ think 'what proportion of the crew survived?', and similar for $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{survived} \mid \textrm{passenger})$

## Probability Consolidation Questions

Today was pretty full-on! Here are some problems to help you consolidate what you learned. Feel free to work on paper or in `R`, whichever you are most comfortable with:

**MVP - try _four_ of the problems**  
**Extension - try more than four!**

<br>
**Question 1.**  
If I roll a six-sided dice once, what is the probability of getting a number less than 5?

```{r}
5/6
```
```{r}
# rolldie(1) %>% 
#   filter()
#   summarise(prob = n() / nrow(6))
```


<br>
**Question 2.**  
How many outcomes are there in the sample space of an experiment in which we toss three dice?

```{r}
#tosscoin()

rolldie(3)
```

<br>

**Question 3.**  
In an experiment where we roll four dice:

  * how many outcomes are in the event where the total of the four dice equals $5$, $6$ or $7$)?
  * what is the probability of this event?
  * what assumptions do we apply in answering part ii?
  
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
For part i, `rowSums(.)` may help you setup up the necessary random variable `total` (or you can use `pivot_longer()`)
</details>
```{r}
four_dice <- rolldie(4)

four_outcome <- four_dice %>% 
  mutate(outcome = rowSums(.)) %>% 
  filter(outcome == 5:7) %>% 
  summarise(prob = n() / nrow(four_dice))

four_outcome
```

<br>

**Question 4.**  
Five chairs are placed in a row in a room, along with five people of differing height. The people sit down randomly on the chairs. What is the probability that they sit in order of decreasing height, left to right?

<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
This is an arrangement where order matters. Of all the possible arrangements, how many are correct?
</details>
```{r}
hight <- c(5, 7, 9, 10, 12)

chairs <- as_tibble(permutations(n = 5, 
                                 r = 5, 
                                 v = hight, 
                                 repeats.allowed = FALSE))

# Gives 120 

chairs_order <- chairs %>% 
  filter(V1 > V2, V2 > V3, V3 > V4, V4 > V5)

# Gives 1

chairs_prob <- chairs_order %>% 
  summarise(prob = n() / nrow(chairs))

# 1/120

chairs_prob

```

<br>
**Question 5.**  
I roll six dice:

  * what is the probability I see the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 in order on the dice, left to right?
  * what is the probability I see one each of the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 on the dice regardless of order?
  
<details>
<summary>**Hint**</summary>
Have a look at the `isin()` function in the `prob` package. For example, to `filter` all rows containing $6$, $1$, $2$ in that order, you could use `isin(., c(6, 1, 2), ordered = TRUE)`
</details>

```{r}
six_roll <- rolldie(6)

# six_dice <- as_tibble(permutations(n = 6, 
#                                    r = 6, 
#                                    v = six_roll, 
#                                    repeats.allowed = FALSE))

# Gives 120 

six_dice_order <- six_roll %>% 
  filter(isin(., C(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), ordered = TRUE))

# no idea but should be 1/46656 = 2.143347e-05
```


<br>
**Question 6.**  
If I draw a single card from a 52-card deck, and it is black, what is the probability that its suit is spades? <br>

<details>
<summary>**Hints**</summary>

* Investigate the `cards()` function in the `prob` package, if you'd like to try this in R (make a deck without jokers). 
* You could think about adding your own `black_card` random variable to the sample space, which would be `TRUE` if the `suit` is 'Spade' or 'Club', and `FALSE` otherwise.
</details>
